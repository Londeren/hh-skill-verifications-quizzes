#### Q12. Listen to the text and choose the right answer. Why doesn’t the man like the Volvo car?

> So, what do you think?
I think I like the Volvo best.
It's so comfortable and I love the colour. It's a really nice shade of blue.
Don't think about the colour. That's a ridiculous reason for buying a car.
The question is, is the golf big enough?
There's not much space for luggage. The boot's much smaller than the Volvo's.
Yes, but think about it. We only go on holiday once a year.
The rest of the time we only use the boot for shopping.
The golf will be much easier to park. That's the advantage of a smaller car.
You know, parking's not your strong point.
I can park perfectly, thank you very much.
Come on, what about last week when you scratched the mirror?
That wasn't parking. It was when I was driving in the high street.
Anyway, Volvo's are the safest cars on the road. Everybody says so.
The Volvo's quite a bit more expensive, you know. If we bought it, we'd have to get a bank loan.
How much more expensive is it?
About 20% more. We wouldn't be able to go to France this summer.
What about the perjo? Over there. It's cheaper than the Volvo and the Golf.
And it's a really sweet yellow.
Look, we've been here more than an hour and I thought we'd agreed we were going to buy either the Volvo or the Golf.
Yes. Now I'm not sure.

- [x] It’s quite expensive

One common form of AI is the virtual assistants in smartphones, which respond to voice commands. The key to AI is its ability to process large amounts of data to identify patterns, similar to human learning. Despite its potential, developing AI involves challenges like advanced programming and understanding human cognition.
